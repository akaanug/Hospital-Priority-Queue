# Hospital-Priority-Queue
CS202 HW3

Question 1

In this programming assignment, you will find a software solution to the problem of the director of Covid-19 Clinic. She is trying to figure out how many doctors should work in this clinic. For each doctor in this clinic, the expense increases; however, according to the standards, the average waiting time for all patients should not exceed a given amount of time. So, she needs to optimize this number and asks for your help in this task. The clinic has the data of past patients. Your program should use these data to calculate average waiting times and find out the minimum number of doctors needed to meet the average waiting time requirement.
1
The data are stored in a plain text file . The first line of the file contains the number of patients. The
subsequent lines contain four integers, each separated by one or more whitespace characters (space or tab). These denote, respectively, the patient id, the patient priority (from 1 to 10, higher is more urgent), arrival time (in minutes from a given pointâ€”e.g., 12:00 am) and service time (in minutes).
For example, from the file content given below, we understand that there are 3 patients. The first patient with id 1 has priority of 9, arrives at the clinic at minute 1, and his examination lasts for 5 minutes. The second patient with id 14 has priority of 3, arrives at the clinic at minute 70, and his examination lasts for 10 minutes. The third patient with id 5 has priority of 3, arrives at the clinic at minute 82, and his examination lasts for 70 minutes.

In your implementation, you may make the following assumptions:
- The data file will always be valid. All data are composed of integers.
- In the data file, the patients are sorted according to their arrival times.
- There may be at most 2000 patients in the data file.
Your implementation must obey the following requirements:
- The patient with the highest priority should be examined first.
- In case of having two patients with the same highest priority, the patient who has waited
longer should be selected first.
- If more than one doctor is available at a given time, the patient is assigned to the doctor with
a lower id.
- Once a patient is assigned to a doctor, the doctor immediately starts examining that patient
and is not available during the examination period given for that patient. After the examination
of that patient ends, the doctor becomes available immediately.
- The waiting time of a patient is the duration (difference) between the arrival time of the
patient and the time he is assigned to a doctor.

Put the class definition and implementation of the heap data structure in maxHeap1.h and maxHeap1.cpp, respectively. Put the function that drives your simulation as well as your main function in a file called simulator.cpp function.
The name of the input file and the maximum average waiting time will be provided as command line arguments to your program. 

Question 2

In the previous question, there is 2000 limit for the number of patients. Now extend your program such that there is no such kind of limit. For that, first dynamically allocate an array with a size of 10 when you construct a heap. Then, double the size (i.e., extend the array by reallocating) if you exceed this number after an insertion. Likewise, halve the size (i.e., this time, shrink the array again by reallocating) if the number of items in the heap falls below the half of the allocated size after a deletion.
Put the class definition and implementation of this extended version in maxHeap2.h and maxHeap2.cpp, respectively. Use the same function names with the implementation that you use in the first question. So, you can use the same driver function given in simulator.cpp.
